This is a model of elevator implemented by MATLAB (Version: R2019B).

- You can run the model by run `main.m`.

- Basic logics are implemented within `.m` files.

- `.mlapp` files are implemented by AppDesigner and provide UI interfaces

- Three unit test files are included: 

  - `unitTestControlUnit.m`

  - `unitTestInsidePanel.m`

  - `unitTestOutsidePanel.m`

    Those files test some of the major functions.

- Four UI test files are included: 

  - `testELEAPP1.m`

  - `testELEAPP2.m`

  - `testELEAPP3.m`

  - `testELEAPP4.m`

    Those files test some of the major use cases.
